# Speech-Recognition
An ML-powered app that classifies emotions in speech (happy, sad, angry, etc.) using the RAVDESS dataset. Audio features are extracted with librosa, and emotion classification is performed using scikit-learn or PyTorch models. Ideal for emotion-aware applications in voice interfaces.
